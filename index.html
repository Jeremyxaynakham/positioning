        <p> 
           Hello, my name is Jeremy Xaynakham and welcome to my site. By the time you leave here you'll get to learn a little about me.
        </p>
        <p>
           I am currently enrolled in the Year Up program taking classes at Seattle Central College.
           Year up’s mission is to close the opportunity divide by ensuring that young adults like myself gain the skills and experience 
           needed to reach their career goals or a higher education. I am in the application development track working towards earning my certification. 
           In my free time I enjoy hiking, building computers and self-development. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I have six years of experience working in customer service. In my previous positions, I have been recognized for my passion for helping others 
           and always having a positive attitude. I am determined to get the job done while also delivering quality work.
        </p>
        <p> 
           My classes combined with my passion for helping others, and always continuing to learn 
           has molded me into an emerging professional. My goal after completing Year Up is to become 
           a Data Analyst Specialist and to take the necessary courses or any other certifications needed 
           to attain a job in tech. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my site and I look forward to connecting with you on LinkedIn or you can email me at jeremyxaynakham@gmail.com 
        </p>
